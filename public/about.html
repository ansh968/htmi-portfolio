<h1>About Me</h1>
<P>“Hello, I am Anshul Sharma, and I will be completing my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from CCS University in August.</P>  
<P>I have worked on a wide variety of projects that have allowed me to put what I’ve learned in the classroom into use in a practical sense. Last year, I was part of a new course where the students managed $500,000 for the Western Annual Fund and it was really exciting to see the portfolio grow.</P>
<P>I pride myself on being detail-oriented, analytical, and driven.  I understand that you are searching for a new investment advisor and I believe these qualities would benefit your company’s goal to increase your client base while continuing to provide sound investment advice.”</P>
